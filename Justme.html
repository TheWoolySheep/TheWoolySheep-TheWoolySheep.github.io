<h1>If you Want to Know, This is Me</h1>
<body>
<p>My name is Mari. I am creating this small website in hopes that it will provide entertainment for at least a little bit. I have done web design for one other semester which is decently fun. However, for my occupation, I plan to go into education. I love working with kids because they just brighten my day. Other things I enjoy is playing the piano, writing stories, writing poems, making my own music, playing with my dog, and swimming. Swimming is one of my favorite things, though.</p>
<p>I have done swimming throughout my high school years and have gone to state in the 500yd freestyle and the 200yd freestyle. That might not sound like much, but when you're swimming it, it's exhausting. I have been swimming since I was 5, so the pool is like my home away from home. I may get tired of teams and all that, but for me, there's nothing more relaxing or comforting as swimming or playing in the pool. </p>
<p>Writing is also something that is important to me. I write lots of stories. I have attached one that I've made the most progress on. The thing is, I tend to start stories but never finish them. As of now, I have 13 stories started and none of them finished. I need to get to work! I also like writing poetry because it gives my emotions so much beauty. Usually, they are love poems or heartbreak poems. I also write my own music if I have the time. Finding a melody though, is complicated.</p>
<p>If you ever have any questions about writing or swimming or want to maybe know me, please email me at: "spamgirl1acc@gmail.com"</p>
