<h1>My Reflection on Making this Site</h1>
<p>Making this site was really more difficult than I though it would be. The hardest parts were the two interactive pages. The math part was hard because I didn't understand how to put earlier functions into an if/else coding. However, with my dad's help I figured it out. The email form was also difficult, but I learned a lot on how to link it with "mailto". This site, although difficult to make, was satisfying to see when I finished. I loved learning new functions and styles.</p>
