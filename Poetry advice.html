<h1>Great ways to write poetry</h1>
<p>I am the type of person who loves poetry, but only writing it. All the lessons about stanzas, rhyming, and accents never really endeared me to poetry classes. If you are like me, I would like to suggest several ways of writing free-form poetry that still includes some of the classic methods of writing.</p>

<ol>
<li>Think about the topic of the poem that you want to write about. This can be anything from nature (birds, scenery, seasons) to personal experiences (emotions, life story). Try and get an idea of how you feel about your topic.</li>
<p>Topic: Love - I feel like this is important and so I will have a more serious thoughtful attitude in this poem.</p>
<li>Figure out what details about your topic you want to include. Is it about you personally? Or is it an observation of life? Are you teaching a lesson?</li>

<li>Figure out some terms and phrases you want to incorporate into your poem</li>
<p>Overused, Said too much, not enough truth, how will she know?</p>

<li>Figure out which perspective you want</li>
<p>I am going to do it in third person</p>


<li>Start your poem with a description, an action, or a feeling.</li>
<p>"I love you." Said too much, not enough truth.</p>


<li>Finish the poem</li>
<p>"I love you." Said too much, not enough truth.</p>
<p>She hears the words but they're overused.</p>
<p>She watches "love" as it crumbles away</p>
<p>only to spring back for another game.</p>
<p>Waiting, holding on for a little more</p>
<p>She wonders if anyone will let her soar</p>
<p>Set her free and tie her down</p>
<p>Where can such a person be found?</p>
