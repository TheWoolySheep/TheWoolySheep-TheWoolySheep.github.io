<h2>About Me</h2>

<p>Hi. My name is Mari. I live in Idaho. I have a big family. (There are 9 people, including me!) I am the third oldest. I have a dog named Buster and a cat named Tess.<p>

<h3>Things I like to do</h3>

<p>There are several activities I like to do. First, I love swimming. Water makes me playful, but it is also a great sport for high school competition. I also like writing. I write poems and I am working on several stories (none of which have been finished). I write my own songs for piano which is another thing I enjoy doing.</p>
