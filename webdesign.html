<h1>Web Design</h1>

<p>This year I took Web Design Section 1. At first, this class was confusing. Actually, it was confusing throughout. But it got better as I went along. I've learned a lot of new things. I learned about HTML coding and CSS. I learned how to add color and images to web pages and to add different fonts. I learned about tables and grids as well as links. This class has been amazing! It's satisfying to code and then open up the page and see how the coding created the page. I always thought coding would be super hard but in reality, once you know the different aspects and what they do, it's kind of easy. At least for technology. </p>
