<p> I am 17 and I am a junior. It means I am closer to becoming an adult. And that's terrifying. I have 6 siblings, 1 dog, 1 cat, 1 penguin, and 3 pandas. Unfortunately, the penguin and pandas aren't real. I like music, art, writing, and poetry.</p>
<p> I have taken Web Design 1 which is nice. It means I won't be totally confused. Or maybe I will. I enjoy this class because it turns nonsense into sense.</p>
