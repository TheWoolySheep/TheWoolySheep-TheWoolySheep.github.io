<h1>Faith</h1>
<p> We all have something we feel is important and to me that's my faith. So I'm going to write a little of my story to show how God has helped me. In 2022, I was not in the best spot. I said I was Catholic, but at the beginning of the year, I didn't act like it. I believed that my life was falling apart because relationships were failing, my faith was becoming weaker, I started harming myself, and I felt like no one understood me. I kind of felt alone. Maybe that's not quite a good reason for saying I was depressed and some people definitely have better excuses. I've even had better reasons later. But I was hurting and so I pushed God away. Then, my mom signed me and my siblings up for a retreat and I got to go. I tried to close myself off from the people around me and to letting God back into my life, but as the retreat continued, I found myself so happy and filled with peace. Throughout the days and months that followed I have struggled with my faith time and time again, but God always brings me back and shows me just how much he cares for me. Now, I try to be happy through everything and trust that God is holding me.</p>
